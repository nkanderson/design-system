## Overview

The loading component provides a general purpose spinner. It will automatically center itself within its containing element. This component also includes a loader of configurable size.

Use the loading indicator when:

- A process is taking long enough that you want the user to know that they system isnâ€™t hung.
- The load time is greater than 1 second. (Do not use the loading indicator when the load time is 1 second or shorter).
