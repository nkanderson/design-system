## Overview

The text component is a foundational element that provides an encapsulated way to use typography, consistent with design system rules. Together the `size` and `color` props determine the rendered typographical variant.

Our products use three font families, with their various weights and sizes, to communicate clearly with our users. Donâ€™t introduce new typographic styles to our products without consulting the UX team.

### Font families

The following 3 font families are utilized in a variety of styles. The use cases for these are outlined below.

- <strong>Calibre</strong>: Headings, titles, navigation, visualizations, and other primary elements (See [Heading](#/React%20Components/Heading))
- <strong>Open Sans</strong>: Body copy and general UI elements and content (like this `Text` component)
- <strong>Inconsolata</strong>: Code samples (See [Code](#/React%20Components/Code))

## Types

### Primary

The primary (default) text is categorized as Body text, used for page content.

- Font Family: Open Sans
- Font weight: 400 Regular
- Size / line height: 14px / 20px

```jsx
<Text>Default text size</Text>
```

## Variations

### Text sizes

Most text should have a size of medium, the default, but small and tiny are also options.

```jsx
<Text><strong>Medium:</strong> Body text is the most common size.</Text>
<Text size="small"><strong>Small:</strong> Small text is used in some places like card content.</Text>
<Text size="tiny"><strong>Tiny:</strong> Tiny text is rarely used.</Text>
```

### Text colors

Take into account expected behavior and accessibility guidelines when using text colors.

#### Neutral colors

Neutral colors are used for the majority of text. They are defined as Base (default), Medium, and Subtle.

```jsx
<Text><strong>Base</strong> (Neutral 900): This is the darkest and the most commonly used.</Text>
<Text color="medium"><strong>Medium</strong> (Neutral 700): This is used to reduce emphasis on text.</Text>
<Text color="subtle"><strong>Subtle</strong> (Neutral 600): This further reduces emphasis and is reserved for asides and supplemental information. Use for heading styles Heading 5 and larger.</Text>
```

#### Stoplight colors

Our "stoplight" colors are reserved to apply meaning, or state, within a given context. Use these for the text component (Body, Small, Tiny). They are defined as Success, Danger, and Warning.

```jsx
<Text color="success"><strong>Success</strong> (Green 700): Used to communicate a successful operation or general approval.</Text>
<Text color="danger"><strong>Danger</strong> (Yellow 600): This communicates a dangerous, irrecoverable action or failure of some kind.</Text>
<Text color="warning"><strong>Warning</strong> (Red 600): This is used to call attention to specific information or to provide a warning. Can also be used to convey an unknown state IF that could be problematic for the user.</Text>
```
