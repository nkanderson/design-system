# Puppet Design System

## Our collective approach to increase consistency, build quickly, and deliver quality experience to our customers.

The Puppet Design System (PDS) is a collection of the common values, behaviors, components, and styles we share at Puppet. It represents our shared objective to quickly deliver value to our customers. With it we scale design across departments, platforms, and time zones.

For background, see [Puppet Design System](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/PDS) on Confluence or watch the [Big Picture presentation](https://primetime.bluejeans.com/a2m/events/playback/33fcd61c-3ad2-4413-9393-cc216551d61b).
